# Intro to CSS Grid Workshop

The resources contained in this repository are designed to go along with 
[this presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18Aa_YjUQOwvWQOoeFPS7n-mVUIIX9myFFupcBgZAXfw/edit?usp=sharing). 
The intent is to provide some material to work with
as an introduction to using CSS Grid in webpage layouts.

These resources can be cloned or downloaded as a ZIP file and do not require any server
or software to run. They are provided here free for everyone to use.

## Examples
Examples are provided in each directory to allow you to experiment
and try different techniques and methods of using CSS Grid. Be sure to consult the
`README.md` file in each example directory for more information about what you
can do with that example. A `solution.css` file is also provided for each one.
