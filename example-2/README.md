# Example 2: Mobile Responsive Layout

A common design case happens when we want to re-organize our layouts to work best on
specific screen sizes. With the proliferation of screens and devices, websites can be
viewed in a range of rations and perspectives. Grid layout helps us acommodate this variety.

## Goal
In this example we will modify the traditional two column layout for different screens. 
This will involve using media queries combined with changing grid templates.

## Solution
A solution is provided in the `solution.css` file. This is provided as inspiration and is 
not the ONLY way to meet the goal. You are encouraged to experiment and find your own solution.

## Stretch Goals

* Add more than one media query breakpoint
* Experiment with re-ordering the content based on viewport size
* This same concept can be applied to methods of allowing users to customize an interface -- experiment with that idea
