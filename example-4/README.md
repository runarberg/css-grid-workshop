# Example 4: Grid and Flex ðŸ’ª

It is often useful to combine page elements that create grid templates and
page elements that use flex to lay out items. Each is a powerful tool when
used to their strengths.

## Goal
In this example we will use a grid-based layout for the page and containers,
and we will use flex to arrange the top nav, sidebar, and main items content.

## Solution
A solution is provided in the `solution.css` file. This is provided as inspiration and is 
not the ONLY way to meet the goal. You are encouraged to experiment and find your own solution.

## Stretch Goals

* Alter the sorting of one or more of the flex areas
* Experiment with using autogrids to generate results similar to flex: Are the results equivalent? How do they differ?
